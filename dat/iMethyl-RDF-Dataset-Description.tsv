Mono	a	Dataset
	purpose	The Human Genome Project (HGP) and 1000 Genome Project (1KGP) uncovered the genomic information and variations of individuals. Presently, much clinical and biological research is based on evidence previously generated by HGP and 1KGP. In the past two decades, researchers elucidated the relationships between diseases and genetic codes using genetic linkage analysis and genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, in this research, most results were only obtained from the four classic bases (A, C, G, and T) of DNA. In the early 1980s, several groups reported the methylation of CpG dinucleotides and lack of methylation at promoter regions. In the late 1990s, methyl-cytosine (mC) was recognized as the fifth base. Recently, several major reports highlighted the relationship between common diseases and CpG methylation (epigenome); however, limited reference epigenome data have been published. In this database, we have included the average, standard deviations, and CpG methylation distributions of monocytes, CD4+ T cells, and neutrophils from over 100 individuals. This dataset is the first population epigenome dataset in the world. We are glad to have the opportunity to accelerate your epigenome research.

MonoSample	a	Sample
	description	PBMCs were stained with CD14-FITC, CD16-PE, CD3-PE/Cy7, and CD4-APC antibodies (5 µL / 500 µL cell suspension; Sony Biotechnology, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) and incubated for 20 min at 4°C. After washing with a 5 × volume of PBS, CD14++/CD16- monocytes and CD3+/CD4+ T cells were immediately sorted using a CellSorter SH800 (Sony) from the monocyte- or lymphocyte-containing gate determined by light-scatter density-plot.
